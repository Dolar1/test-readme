1. We have made two dynamic components in our app
  - dynamicGallery
  - dynamicGallery2

2. Follow the docs from [Deferred components](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/deferred-components).

3. Was able to build and test **apk** locally via local testing commands given in doc.
 - <details> 
    <summary>Local Testing Commands</summary>
    
    ``` sh
     java -jar bundletool.jar build-apks --bundle=<your_app_project_dir>/build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab --output=<your_temp_dir>/app.apks --local-testing
     java -jar bundletool.jar install-apks --apks=<your_temp_dir>/app.apks
    ```

4. When we put dynamic delivery project folder inside android in the root of flutter project
 - i.e. => flutter_project/android/dynamicallery & dynamicallery2
 The folder structure as given below.

.
|â”€â”€ flutter_project/
     |â”€â”€ android/
        |â”€â”€ dynamicGallery/
        â”‚   |â”€â”€ src/
        â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AndroidManifest.xml
        â”‚   |â”€â”€ build.gradle
        â”‚   |â”€â”€ dexguards-config.gradle
        |â”€â”€ dynamicGallery2/
        â”‚   |â”€â”€ src/
        â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AndroidManifest.xml
        â”‚   |â”€â”€ build.gradle
        â”‚   |â”€â”€ dexguards-config.gradle

5.  We are able to compile with dexguard configs too.

6. It results in generating extra symbols for dynamicallery & dynamicallery2 based on the .part.so which is the content for the aab file. [check image below]

7. Content of symbol file with & without adding deferred components check image below
<img width="786" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-30 at 2 30 13 PM" src="https://github.com/flutter/flutter/assets/33690796/5f45ac02-bf5b-46a3-9947-03bbedbdac6d">

8. As a result we are not able to upload .symbols-x.part.so file to firebase, as it results in error.
 - saying native library found
 
9. And the crashes are not able to be symbolicated for deferred component part of the android app.
